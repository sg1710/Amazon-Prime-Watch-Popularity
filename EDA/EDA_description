This Jupyter Notebook is the heart of the analysis and machine learning development for the Amazon Prime dataset. It includes all essential steps — from importing and cleaning raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a predictive regression model. The notebook starts by merging and cleaning the titles.csv and credits.csv datasets, handling null values, converting genres into usable formats, and engineering a new column to isolate the main genre for each title. It then proceeds to visualize content trends using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. For modeling, the notebook applies one-hot encoding to categorical features and uses a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn to predict IMDb scores. The model’s performance is evaluated using R² and RMSE metrics. The notebook also includes final steps to generate the prediction dataset used in Tableau. It is well-commented and modular, so any user can follow the process and reproduce the results. This file connects raw insights to final predictions and is suitable for analysts, data scientists, and students who want to understand full-cycle machine learning project execution.
