This raw dataset contains information on Amazon Prime Video titles, including name, release year, genres, and IMDb scores. It is the foundational file used in this project and was merged with credits.csv to create the cleaned dataset. Each row represents a unique title available on Amazon Prime. The genres are presented in comma-separated strings, which required transformation for analysis. While this file includes valuable information, it contains some inconsistencies and null values, making it unsuitable for direct modeling. As a result, it was subjected to cleaning and feature extraction processes. It served as the source for important variables such as release_year, genres, and imdb_score. The dataset helped answer trend-based questions such as “Which genre dominates in which decade?” and “How has the average rating changed over time?” Though it is not used directly in Tableau or ML after preprocessing, it is included in the repository to maintain transparency and enable raw data exploration for other users.
