This file is the cleaned and pre-processed dataset used for machine learning and visualization. It is derived from merging two raw files â€” titles.csv and credits.csv. After handling missing values, filtering incomplete rows, and standardizing text fields, this CSV includes finalized columns such as release_year, main_genre, and imdb_score. The cleaning process involved stripping unnecessary white spaces, converting genres to lowercase, removing duplicate entries, and simplifying multi-genre entries to a single dominant genre. This transformation makes the data ready for analysis and modeling, minimizing preprocessing time for future users. It also ensures compatibility with Tableau and Python-based ML models. This dataset was crucial in one-hot encoding categorical variables and training the regression model. It represents a reliable, clean foundation on which trend analysis and prediction models were built. Users who want to start their own analysis can directly use this file without redoing preprocessing steps. It supports transparency and reproducibility of the project by making the core input data available. It is also export-friendly for BI tools, spreadsheets, and other platforms.
